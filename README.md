## Unite spelling suggestion source

A [unite.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim) source that displays Vim’s spelling suggestions for a word.

### Usage

No Vim documentation, but `:Unite spell_suggest[:word]` will display a list of suggestions in the Unite interface. The selected candidate will replace the current word, if applicable, else Unite’s default word handling applies.

* without an argument, suggestions are based on the current word (Vim’s `<cword>`, which is not strictly equivalent to the word under the cursor);
* an argument of `?` will prompt for a word to base suggestions on;
* set `g:unite_spell_suggest_limit` to limit the number of suggestions retrieved by Vim’s `spellsuggest()` (by default, this variable is unset).

### Caveats

Vim’s `spellsuggest()` only returns suggestions if `spell` is set in the current buffer (see `:h spellsuggest()`), and hence the Unite source will remain empty if it is unset. Use the `-no-empty` option to skip empty suggestion lists.

The replace operation *will* take multi-byte characters in the word to be replaced in stride; its correctness when replacing double wide characters, however, has not been tested (reports are welcome).
